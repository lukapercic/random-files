## Additional Information
We encountered challenges when implementing the largest EC curves, `secp521r1`, and `brainpoolP512r1`. Due to the limited available stack space in the WebAssembly environment (8KB), we had to create a new `flexbuffer` to store the big integer state on the heap for these curves.

Currently, the issue with this new buffer is that, due to the compile-time construction requirements of the ack library, the heap-allocated memory is never freed (C++17 doesn't support compile-time destructors). Therefore, the buffer should only be used in short-lived environments, such as WebAssembly.

As expected and evident in the benchmark report, brainpool R curves can be significantly slower. The reason for this is the chosen curve parameters for which no special EC arithmetic can be applied (i.e., _a_ ≡ −3 (mod _p_) or _a_ ≡ 0).
It's worth noting that there are also brainpool twisted curves (T) for which _a_ ≡ −3 (mod _p_). However, due to their limited usage in real-world applications, they were omitted from implementation.

The implementation of public key recovery from ECDSA signature is, as expected, slightly slower than ECDSA signature verification. This is due to the requirement of reconstructing point `R` from the signature component `r`, which requires additional implementation of modular square root.
The modular square root implementation uses the standard Tonelli-Shanks algorithm to calculate square roots in modular arithmetic and has additional optimization for when the curve prime is equal to _p_ ≡ 3 (mod 4). This optimization provides roughly a two-fold boost and applies to all implemented curves in the ack library.

Additionally, for this milestone, we implemented point decompression from the point's x-coordinate (required for reconstruction of point `R`) and point encoding/decoding (SEC1-v2 section 2.3.3 & 2.3.4).
